Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

To install **package name**, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install package_name

This is the preferred method to install **package name**, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for Python Boilerplate can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone {{github_repository}}

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL {{github_repository}}/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install

.. _Github repo: {{github_repository}}
.. _tarball: {{github_repository}}/tarball/master
