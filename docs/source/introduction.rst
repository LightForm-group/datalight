Description
===========

*Datalight* is a python software developed to help researcher in their
 data management and data curation by providing a simple tool to
 upload their important data on a data repository. For now, there are
 only one data repository available: `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`_.

This repository, before publishing the data, need some information
related to them which has to be provided by the uploader. This
informations are called metadata and will be provided through the
usage of a `**YAML** <https://yaml.org>`_ file. These informations are
very specific and one of the role of the software is to validate the
file structures to be sure that the upload will not failed because of
an error inside it.

The software is written in `Python 3 <https://python.org>`_. It is
multiplateform and should run without any problems (but bugs) on the
main plateforms: Linux, MS Windows and MacOS X.
