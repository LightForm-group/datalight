Description
===========

*Datalight* is a a program developed to help researchers with their
data management and data curation by providing a simple tool to
upload their data to a data repository. At the moment Datalught only 
uploads to one data repository: `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`_.

Along with the data to upload the user must add some metadata to provide
information about the data being uploaded. The metadata must be provided in 
`YAML <https://yaml.org>`_ files. The metadata has a specific format and
required fields and one of the roles of datalight is to validate the
metadata before upload to make sure the upload will succeed.

The software is written in `Python 3 <https://python.org>`_. It is
multiplatform and should run on Linux, MS Windows and MacOS X.
