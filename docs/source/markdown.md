# A very simple markdown document

Just a small example to show that Sphinx can now be used with markdown and not only restructuredText. There are still some limitations (mathjax does not work with markdown) but it is functional.

More information can be found in the description of the Markdown flavor

## Example on how-to do inline math

This formula

``` `$ y=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x^i} $` ```

will bre represent as: `$ y=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x^i} $`
